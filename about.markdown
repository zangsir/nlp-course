# Course description 
NLP is now at the center of AI, data science and data analytics. There is a wealth of textual data online. NLP-enabled products constitute an essential part of everyday life, both in consumer facing products (Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT, Google Translate, etc.) and B2B applications (e.g., NLP for medical and legal domains). However, understanding human languages and extracting structured information from this plethora of unstructured text data is a major challenge for computers. The recent advancement in machine learning and deep learning makes NLP one of the fastest growing fields in AI and data science. In this course, we will survey machine learning (ML) based NLP techniques from statistical ML approaches to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on building a solid understanding of the history and theory of NLP that led to the current LLMs. Students will read the latest research papers, implement NLP algorithms or train/fine-tune deep learning/LLM models for a variety of NLP tasks, as well as completing a final project and research paper on a topic of their interest.

# Homework, presentations and final projects

To adapt to the rapidly evolving field of NLP, this course is designed to simulate the real-world environment of a R&D NLP/AI practitioner wherever possible. Instead of being a static, lecture and exam based course, the students will have plenty of opportunities to actively conduct independent research, collaborate with teammates, present their projects, and keep up with the SOTA research on NLP and AI. Each student will be assigned to a team in the class. Each team is reponsible for delivering multiple code reviews and presenting on research papers throughout the term. Students will then have the opportunity to form their own teams to conduct a month-long research project on a topic of interest that will result in a final paper with the potential to submit to a conference for publication.
