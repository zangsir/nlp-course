## Course Description

NLP is now at the center of AI, data science and data analytics. There is a wealth of textual data online. NLP-enabled products constitute an essential part of everyday life, both in consumer facing products (Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT, Google Translate, etc.) and B2B applications (e.g., NLP for medical and legal domains). However, understanding human languages and extracting structured information from this plethora of unstructured text data is a major challenge for modern computers. The recent advancement in machine learning and deep learning makes NLP one of the fastest growing fields in AI and data science. In this course, we will survey ML-based NLP techniques from statistical ML approaches to the SOTA deep learning models. Students will be able to apply the ML and NLP skills learned in this course to real world problems in a variety of jobs (NLP/ML engineer, NLP data scientist, data scientist, data analyst, etc) and industries/sectors (finance, medical insurance, technology, urban planning, education, etc.). 

Prerequisites: proficient in python coding; familiarity with probability, linear algebra and calculus
